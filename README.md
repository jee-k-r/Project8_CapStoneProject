## 4. Data Description
This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all
relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their landline
business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you’re an
analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online
backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method,
paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## 5. Identify the target variable
The Goal is to predict whether or not a particular customer is likely to retain services. This is
represented by the Churn column in dataset. Churn=Yes means customer leaves the company,
whereas Churn=No implies customer is retained by the company.
